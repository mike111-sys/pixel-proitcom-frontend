// Good, working well. I have some more changes i need, i should select an icon in the category image in the admin, not an image, you can put a list of react icons to choose from that will be displayed before the category name in the navbar and other places the category appears. And, in the navbar categories dropdown, the categories themselves eg electronics, should have dropdowns also that shows the products in those categories(for easy selection from the navbar), and lastly, create a change password button in the admin so that one can change the existing password. Do a perfect job
